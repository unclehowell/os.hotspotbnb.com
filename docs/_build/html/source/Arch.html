<h1>Installing Arch Linux on laptop and how to make it usable<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-arch-linux-on-laptop-and-how-to-make-it-usable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this tutorial I’d like to cover all steps from installing Arch Linux
OS to stable, secure, and working system with working Wi-Fi, windows
manager (i3) etc.</p>
<p>All my current configs are in this repository. Feel free to inspire from
them (as I did from others).</p>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are tons of step-by-step guides how to install Arch so I will not
go to deep here. Just look to <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">&lt;nstallation guide</a>. Anyway, short summary:</p>
<div class="section" id="primary-installation">
<h3>Primary installation<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="partitioning">
<h4>Partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#partitioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>You have to prepare disc(s) where you’ll install Arch Linux. One disc
can be separated to more partitions. I recommend you to use two partitions
for Arch Linux. One for system and second for user data (alias “home
directory”). You can of course have one or more - as you wish. In this
tutorial I will use 2 partition. It doesn’t matter if there are next
partitions with other systems (next Linux, Windows…). How big
partitions should be? I recommend you 40GB-50GB for system and rest for
home. The easiest way to partition is to use GParted. If you are using
Linux, you can download from your distribution and make it from there.
Of course, you’ll not be able to resize, create etc. partitions on disc
which is currently used. In that case, or if you don’t have Linux, there
is GParted life distribution - make a booting USB flash with that. In
GParted you have to create two partitions with previously stated sizes
and format them to file system “ext4”. Piece of cake. For convenience
it’s fine to label them also (when you create partition, you can add
label).</p>
<p>There might be problem with your BIOS - it don’t have to has booting
from USB flash as default. You need to change an order of priority in
your BIOS (the “thing” before operating systems boots up). Google is
your friend :) .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-arch-linux">
<h4>Installing Arch Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-arch-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now you have prepared disc for installation. Download last ISO of
Arch Linux and make a booting USB flash with that. When you’ll be done
with that, insert USB flash to PC and run it. It should boot up to
Arch Linux prompt (terminal, console). Now we need to connect to the
internet. You can use command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Wi-Fi-menu</span></code> or just plug in ethernet
cable. To check if you are connect, try <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ping</span> <span class="pre">google.com</span></code>. If you get
response, it’s working. Now we need to join prepared partitions to
currently running OS. Which are they? You can find it out by typing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lsblk</span></code>. There will be listed all partitions. You care about the two
you partitioned earlier. You should recognize them thanks to the size.
If you are not sure, you’ll find it out in a minute. In my case, there
is /dev/sda5 for system (40GB) and /dev/sda6 for home. Of course it
might differ from yours, so substitute it to your case. Do *
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mount</span> <span class="pre">/dev/sda5</span> <span class="pre">/mnt</span></code> * check if it is empty <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">/mnt</span></code>. If you
don’t see anything (or there is only something like <em>lost+found</em>), it’s
our partition :). * Create directory for home <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mkdir</span> <span class="pre">/mnt/home</span></code> *
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mount</span> <span class="pre">/dev/sda6</span> <span class="pre">/mnt/home</span></code></p>
<p>Now we can physically install Arch Linux. Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacstrap</span> <span class="pre">/mnt</span> <span class="pre">base</span></code> and
waits. It will download and install packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="post-install">
<h4>Post install<a class="headerlink" href="#post-install" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now we need to tell system which partition is system disc and which home
partition. This will help us a little: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">genfstab</span></code></p>
<p>Link some zone info</p>
<p>TODO</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="change-root-settings">
<h4>Change root settings<a class="headerlink" href="#change-root-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now we will change root to new system - from the current one, which is
the USB one, we will magically get to the new. This magic will happen by
command: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">arch-chroot</span> <span class="pre">/mnt</span></code>.</p>
<p>We need to install packages for connecting to the internet as we did on
the start of installation. For that, we will need these packages (which
are included on this USB version, but not on installation):
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">dialog</span> <span class="pre">wpa_actiond</span> <span class="pre">ifplugd</span> <span class="pre">wpa_suppicant</span> <span class="pre">sudo</span> <span class="pre">zsh</span></code> That
should be sufficient for making Wi-Fi or wired connection in our new
system, when we finish work from here. There are also two useful
packages <em>sudo</em> and <em>zsh</em>. I will cover them in next paragraph.</p>
<p>In Linux, there is always one user, which is equivalent to god. His name
is “root”. You are currently login as him. We will change a password for
him. Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">passwd</span></code> and set new password. We also want to add regular
user (think about it as a god who is creating humans). This can be done
by: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">useradd</span> <span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">-G</span> <span class="pre">wheel</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">/usr/bin/zsh</span> <span class="pre">username</span></code>, where username is
as you wish. I will use “bob” in next chapters as default user. There
are also some other switches in command. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> is for creating bob’s
sandbox for his files and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-G</span></code> to add him to the wheel group. Why?
Remember installing sudo and mentioning root? It is better working as
bob (being god all the time means a lot of responsibility), but
sometimes has some superpowers as root has. Sudo will do it for as.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code> can grant you superusers privileges. More about it here. Now
the wheel group. Every user, who is in wheel group, will have this
ability to use sudo. Type: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">visudo</span></code> and find this line:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">%wheel</span> <span class="pre">ALL=(ALL)</span> <span class="pre">ALL</span></code> and delete # character (for future reference,
this means to “uncomment line”). It will look like this
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%wheel</span> <span class="pre">ALL=(ALL)</span> <span class="pre">ALL</span></code>. Save and exit (in vim just press escape and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:x</span></code>). Next switch in creating command was <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">/usr/bin/zsh</span></code>. This
will just save your time in terminal (where you’ll be a lot). Enough for
now. We will make this also for root by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chsh</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">/usr/bin/zsh</span></code>. Last
thing - we need to set password for bob. Do it by typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">passwd</span> <span class="pre">bob</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bootloader">
<h4>Bootloader<a class="headerlink" href="#bootloader" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We need to tell to your PC what systems are installed and add you the
ability to choose between them (windows, Linux(other distros)…). For that we will
need one or two more packages <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">grub</span></code>. If you have windows
installed on other partitions, also install <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">os-prober</span></code>.
When you boot your PC there is APROXIMATELY this sequence: * BIOS - it
then looks to the beginning of your disc for first part of GRUB * GRUB
first stage - if it is found, GRUB takes control and then looks for
other files with more informations and pass control to GRUB second stage
* GRUB second stage - it gives you option to choose system you want to
boot up and then kick it up * OS will boot up this is not precise, but
sufficient for our purposes and to be honest, for 90% of what you need
on <em>daily</em> basis (personally, I don’t know more than this :) ). BIOS is
installed from factory. So our work is to install GRUB stages. Resolve
which disc you want to use - I recommend you to use the first one,
which is usually called /dev/sda. If you have only one disc in PC, it is
this one :) .</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong> - notice that I’m not speaking about partition, in which
case I’d need to add number after sda. First stage of GRUB is somehow
“partition” independent. OK, now install it:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grub-install</span> <span class="pre">--target=i386-pc</span> <span class="pre">--recheck</span> <span class="pre">/dev/sda</span></code> again - now number
after sda. Of course, change <strong>a</strong> to your case. Now we need to install
second stage of GRUB. It will be to the current system partition, so run
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grub-mkconfig</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">/boot/grub/grub.cfg</span></code>. Now you are ready to restart
your PC. Do it by typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shutdown</span> <span class="pre">now</span></code>, plug off USB flash and turn
PC on again. If everything went well, you should be in white-black
window with names of available systems. Choose Arch, of course. If not,
just boot again from USB flash, mount system partitions with already
installed system, arch-chroot inside it and try installing grub again or
find what went wrong. Don’t panic :).</p>

<div class="section" id="login-in">
<h3>Login in<a class="headerlink" href="#login-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You should be looking to the Arch Linux console with asking for username
and password. You have two options now: sign in as bob or as a root. For
now, I recommend you to join as a root because we will maintain the
system for a while. But for future, always use regular user for common
tasks and when you need root privileges., use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code> command. So,
username is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> and password is the one you specified in the past.
If you forgot it, you can again boot up from USB flash, arch chroot and
change it.</p>

<div class="section" id="setting-connection">
<h3>Setting connection<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-connection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will set up simple connection manager, which will auto connect to known
Wi-Fi networks and auto connect if you plug in a ethernet cable. If you’ll
want to connect to new yet unknown Wi-Fi network, you will use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Wi-Fi-menu</span></code>.</p>
<p>So now connect to internet using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Wi-Fi-menu</span></code>. Now we will enable
networking daemon (things which runs silently on the background) to
start after boot. For that we’ll need how is your Wi-Fi or ethernet
device inside your laptop called. We can find it by typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ip</span> <span class="pre">addr</span></code>.

<p>you care about the two of them, which starts with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wlp...</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enp...</span></code>. Let’s say it’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enp2s0</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wlp3s0</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to start autoconnect to known networks. Let’s do that
by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">systemctl</span> <span class="pre">enable</span> <span class="pre">netctl-auto&#64;wlp3s0</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">systemctl</span> <span class="pre">enable</span> <span class="pre">netctl-ifplugd&#64;enp2s0</span></code>. That’s it. Now, if you wan’t
to connect to unknown Wi-Fi, just type (needs root) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Wi-Fi-menu</span></code> and
when you want cable connection, just plug it in :) .</p>

<div class="section" id="installing-i3">
<h4>Installing i3<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-i3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As I sad before, we are going to use <a class="reference external" href="http://i3wm.org/">I3</a>. Take a
look at there webpage and guide. For make it run we will need to install
these <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">i3</span> <span class="pre">dmenu</span> <span class="pre">xorg</span> <span class="pre">xorg-xinit</span></code>. It might ask you about
some choices - just install anything. It isn’t necessary to have all
crap from Xorg, but to figure out which is and which isn’t needed is
just pain (<a class="reference external" href="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/">wayland</a> should solve
this in near future). If it asks you about installing i3-status, approve
it. Xorg is used for all advance displaing in linux. i3 needs it also.
When you run a graphic enviroment anywhere on linux, it means that Xorg
is runned and than there might be some windows managers etc. So now we
just tell Xorg to run i3 after it’s start. To do that, we will edit this
file: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vim</span> <span class="pre">~/.xinitrc</span></code> to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#! /bin/bash</span>
<span class="n">exec</span> <span class="n">i3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>this should be sufficient. Since now, you can start i3 by typing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">startx</span></code> (try it :) ). To quit from i3 back to console press
Windows+Shift+E or Ctrl+Alt+Del. How to actually use i3 we will cover in
next part.</p>
<p>We’d like to start i3 (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">startx</span></code>) after logging in after boot. Open
file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/profile</span></code> and add there this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># autostart systemd default session on tty1</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">[[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$(tty)&quot;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/dev/tty1&#39;</span> <span class="p">]];</span> <span class="n">then</span>
    <span class="n">exec</span> <span class="n">startx</span>
<span class="n">fi</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What this does? Next time you reboot your computer and you log in with
your username and password, i3 will start :) . If you don’t want to
start i3 and you just need console (or i3 is broken), you can just
change <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7765949_switch-tty.html">tty</a>. Linux
has by default 7 of them. In majority of distributions with DE (desktop
enviroment) Xorg is running on seventh tty. In our case it will be the
first one.</p>

<h4>Configuring i3 status bar<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-i3-status-bar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>i3status bar is just what is is - status bar. After install you need to
edit it a bit. It’s located in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.i3status</span></code>. Usually it is necessary
to adjust these: <strong>battery</strong> You have to find out <strong>number* of your
battery. Type ``ls /sys/class/power_supply``. It should show something
like ``ADP1 BAT1``. Number after ``BAT`` is you lucky number. Usually
it’s 1 or 0. **wireless and ethernet device name</strong> Here you need to
replace <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wlan0</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eth0</span></code> with ones you have. To find it out again
type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ip</span> <span class="pre">addr</span></code>. There should be something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wlp1s0</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enp2s0</span></code> (on older distros there is still wlan0 or eth0 - in that case
keep it as is :) ) .</p>

<h4>Install yaourt and AUR<a class="headerlink" href="#install-yaourt-and-aur" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Archlinux has several <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Linux_Repositories">official
repositories</a>
and also unofficial <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR">AUR</a>.
It’s not trivial to install packages from there and there are helpers
for that, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yaourt</span></code>, which is equivalent to pacman for oficial
repos.</p>
<p>In AUR are usefull packages as Oracle Java implementation, proprietary
software, software which is used rarely etc.</p>
<p>To install yaourt do this: * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">base-devel</span> <span class="pre">wget</span></code> *
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wget</span> <span class="pre">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pa/package-query/package-query.tar.gz</span></code>
* <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wget</span> <span class="pre">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ya/yaourt/yaourt.tar.gz</span></code>
* <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tar</span> <span class="pre">xvf</span> <span class="pre">package-query.tar.gz</span></code> * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">package-query</span></code> *
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makepkg</span> <span class="pre">-s</span></code> * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-U</span> <span class="pre">package-query*</span></code> *
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tar</span> <span class="pre">xvf</span> <span class="pre">yaourt.tar.gz</span></code> * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">yaourt</span></code> * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makepkg</span> <span class="pre">-s</span></code> *
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-U</span> <span class="pre">yaourt*</span></code></p>
<p>That’s it. We have installed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yaourt</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package-query</span></code> from AUR
and you see that it is not hard, but seems a bit…</p>
<p>…ehh - long. Now, to install something from AUR, for example
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copy-agent</span></code>, just type: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yaourt</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">copy-agent</span></code>. It will do all this
for you :) . Why this is not allowed by default? It might be danger to
install something from AUR, since everyone can add there something. So
be aware of that!</p>

<p><strong>Office suite</strong> My choice of office suite (alternative to MS Office) is
Libre office.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span> <span class="pre">libreoffice-writer</span> <span class="pre">libreoffice-calc</span> <span class="pre">libreoffice-impress</span></code>.
(I will not type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pacman</span> <span class="pre">-S</span></code> since now when I’ll talk about
installing) <strong>PDF viewer</strong> I like lightweigt and fast viewer called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zathura</span></code>. Install <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zathura</span> <span class="pre">zathura-pdf-poppler</span></code> <strong>Text editor</strong>
Even I use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vim</span></code> for 90% of my work, sometimes is usefull to has
simple graphic text editor. I’d recommend <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geany</span></code>. <strong>Partitioning</strong>
Just <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gparted</span></code>. Great tool. <strong>FTP client</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">filezilla</span></code> <strong>Graphics</strong>
For low level use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">imagemagick</span></code>. For something <em>normal</em> use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpicview</span></code>. Instead of photoshop use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gimp</span></code>. <strong>Analyzing processes
etc.</strong> * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">htop</span></code> - processes * <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iotop</span></code> - writes to disk <strong>LaTex</strong>
All you in most cases need is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">texlive-core</span></code>. The rest is optional and
install it only if you need it.</p>
<p>For editor I’d recommend <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">texmaker</span></code> for beginners and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">texworks</span></code> for
the rest.</p>
<p><strong>tree</strong> Try it in terminal :) . Show structure of current folder. To
limit <em>level</em> type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tree</span> <span class="pre">-L</span> <span class="pre">&lt;n&gt;</span></code>. <strong>torrents</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transmission-gtk</span></code></p>
<p><strong>Console-based browser</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lynx</span></code> - it can be handy when you need
web-browser and can’t run graphical enviroment. <strong>Console based file
manager</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ranger</span></code> - vim like bindings, tabs, written in python and
fast file manager? YES! <strong>media player</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vlc</span></code> should be sufficient.</p>

<p>What does it mean? Broswer are storing tons of data to <em>cache</em> for
faster loading next time. It’s waering out the disc (to much writes) and
it’s slow. To do this, follow these links:
